## About Me

I hope you're doing great! I am Hangoo Kang, a senior undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC), pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.

Currently, I am working at the <strong>FOrmally Certified Automation and Learning (FOCAL) Lab</strong>, advised by [Professor Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/) on Trustworthy AI, Agentic AI, Adversarial RLHF training, and Programming Language on AI. I am also part of the <strong>Approximate and Resilient Computing (ARC) Lab</strong> where I am advised by [Professor Sasa Misailovic](https://misailo.cs.illinois.edu/). With guidance from Professor Misailovic, I am researching the potential of applying programming language principles to AI systems. Specifically, I have been developing a grammar-constrained decoding algorithm to ensure syntactical correctness in AI-generated outputs. Additionally, I am collaborating with [Professor Minjia Zhang](https://minjiazhang.github.io/) on AI safety, exploring the vulnerability of state-of-the-art language models to minimal noise on their input system.

## Research Interests
