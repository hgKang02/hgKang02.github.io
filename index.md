## About Me

I hope you're doing great! I am Hangoo Kang, an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, pursuing in B.S. in Computer Science.

Currently, I am working at the FOrmally Certified Automation and Learning (FOCAL) Lab, advised by Professor Gagandeep Singh on Trustworthy AI, Agentic AI, Adversarial RLHF training, and Programming Langauge on AI. I am also part of the Approximate and Resilient Computing (ARC) Lab where I am advised by Professor Sasa Misailovic. With the guidance from Professor Misailovic, I am researching the potentials of applying programming language principles to AI systems. Specifically, I have been working on developing grammar constrained decoding algorithm to ensure syntactical correctness in AI-generated outputs.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** Safety, Robustness, Agents, Bias in AI
- **Programming Language:** Grammar Guided Generation, Software Verification, Program Synthesis
