## About Me

I'm Hangoo Kang, a first-year M.S. student in Computer Science (MSCS) at Stanford University.

I work in the **Scaling Intelligence Lab** with [Professor Azalia Mirhoseini](http://azaliamirhoseini.com/), focusing on continuous learning for agentic AI and AI reasoning. I'm also part of **xLab**, advised by [Professor Yejin Choi](https://yejinc.github.io/), where I study model collapse and trustworthiness in multi-turn environments. Before Stanford, I worked with [Professor Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/), [Professor Sasa Misailovic](https://misailo.cs.illinois.edu/), and [Professor Minjia Zhang](https://minjiazhang.github.io/) on safety in agentic AI systems, grammar-constrained decoding, and mitigating reward hacking in RLHF.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** Trustworthy AI, Agents, Multimodal Models, Post-training
- **Programming Languages:** Grammar-Guided Generation, Software Verification, Program Synthesis
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Continuous Learning, RLHF, Robust Verifiers
